# First Blockchain

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
I implemented UselessCoin (ULC) in Python to understand the basics of blockchain systems. 
It shows the links between blocks and how hashing is used.

## Features
- Basic **blockchain structure** with linked blocks.
- **[SHA-256 hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)** for data integrity.
